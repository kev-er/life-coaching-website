üöÄ How It's Made

Tech Stack: React, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript

The website is built with 
* XHTML for structure
* CSS for styling and responsiveness
* JavaScript for interactive elements




üîß Optimisations


I used the developer tool in brower which is a must in my opinion as it enable to see how the website preforms as well as looking that your stylings and make quick changes in the DOM to experiment before adding into in css. 

I deepened my proficiency in HTML for structured content, CSS for aesthetic presentation, and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. It was fun and the time this project took was very short compare to some of my projects four months ago 


üéØ Lessons Learned

<b>HUGE LESSON LEARNED</b>
This project was a journey‚Äînot just in coding but in understanding client relationships, expectations, and communication.

I built this website for a friend, working alongside another mate who is a graphic designer. He created a concept piece, which I used as my foundation. Throughout the process, I made sure to be transparent, always asking for honest feedback and offering to pivot if needed. Each time we met, the "client" was enthusiastic, saying it looked awesome. I took that as a green light to continue refining the design.

Since the concept piece only showed a desktop layout, I focused on building the desktop version first. It wasn‚Äôt until much later that I realized the "client" only really cared about the mobile experience. When I finally presented the unfinished product, he completely changed his mind about the entire design.

In the end, the client and the designer took a walk, talked it out, and decided to take things in a completely different direction‚Äîscrapping everything I had built.
Takeaways:

* Ask the right questions early ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo you like it?‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough. Dig deeper into what the client actually needs.
* Clarify priorities ‚Äì If mobile is the priority, build for mobile first.
* Expect changes ‚Äì Even with approval at every step, minds can change. Be prepared for pivots.

Despite the outcome, this was a valuable learning experience in handling client relationships and managing expectations. 

I don't regret doing this site at all as I learned quite a few valuable lessons. 




This was when React started to click more with older version to kinda getting the feel of how it is out the real world of manage and maintaining a tech stack. 

Developer Tools: Browser DevTools were essential for performance analysis, testing styles, and experimenting with DOM changes before committing them to CSS.

Skill Growth: This project reinforced my knowledge of React and XHTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 

Compared to projects I built four months ago, I noticed a significant improvement in efficiency and development speed.
