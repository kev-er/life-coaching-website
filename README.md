ðŸ”§ Optimisations

To improve performance, I optimised image loading times by compressing each image, reducing their size by approximately 69%. This significantly improved page load speed, ensuring a smoother experience for visitors.


Also,I used the developer tool in brower which is a must in my opinion as it enable to see how the website preforms as well as looking that your stylings and make quick changes in the DOM to experiment before adding into in css. 

I deepened my proficiency in HTML for structured content, CSS for aesthetic presentation, and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. It was fun and the time this project took was very short compare to some of my projects four months ago 


ðŸŽ¯ Lessons Learned

Neovim Challenge: I built this project using Neovim, which was a great experience. It felt faster and improved my workflow.

Developer Tools: Browser DevTools were essential for performance analysis, testing styles, and experimenting with DOM changes before committing them to CSS.

Skill Growth: This project reinforced my knowledge of HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 

Compared to projects I built four months ago, I noticed a significant improvement in efficiency and development speed.
