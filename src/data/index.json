Possessing a wisdom that has been forged from experience and reflection. Quicker to listen than to speak. His probing questions are provocative. Unfurling the hidden core beliefs one has operated from and with gentle yet assertive authority. Mikes involvement has been monumental in my life. Mike has partnered with me - in a dignifying way - to explore the why. It has been accompanied with guidance that acts as a handrails into a fuller and freer life. I'm grateful for the role Mike has played and continues to in this part of my journey.",
