            Hi, Iâ€™m Mike. I am a Pastor and a Coach, and myself and my wife Abi
            live in the beautiful Surrey, England. Over the years, going through
            my own journey of personal transformation (A journey that never
            ends!) I have grown incredibly passionate about helping people
            become who they were designed to be.
          </p>
          <br />

            Throughout my life I've journeyed through trauma, unhelpful
            mindsets, bad habits, facing my greatest fears, and journeying
            through broken relationships to get to a place of thriving abundant
            life. I want to help you in your journey to have the same story. To
            move from surviving to thriving. To become you, you were created to
            be.
